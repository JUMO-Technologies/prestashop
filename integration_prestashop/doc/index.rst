 Quick configuration guide
==========================

|

1. Install the Odoo PrestaShop Connector on your Odoo server â€“ How to install in `Odoo.sh <https://youtu.be/p4KE10FbYk0>`__

|

2. Then follow steps from this video to make an initial configuration of our Odoo PrestaShop connector (`video <https://youtu.be/0Tz3FTiyR50>`__)

|

3. As our connector is using queue_job from OCA, you need to make sure also to properly configure your Odoo instance. Specifically check that you have below in your odoo.conf file:

    3.1. Make sure that number of workers is 2 and higher (e.g. workers = 4)

    3.2. Make sure queue_job module is added to server wide modules (e.g. server_wide_modules = web,queue_job)

    3.3. Add the following lines specific to queue_job to identify amount of channels that will be used for it
        | [queue_job]
        | channels = root:1
